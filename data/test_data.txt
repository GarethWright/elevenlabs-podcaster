a computer scientist or mathematician. With computers having become prevalent in
our modern lives, however, the term is no longer esoteric. If you look around your
home, you’ll ûnd algorithms running in the most mundane places: your microwave
oven, your washing machine, and, of course, your computer. You ask algorithms
to make recommendations to you: what music you might like or what route to
take when driving. Our society, for better or for worse, asks algorithms to suggest
sentences for convicted criminals. You even rely on algorithms to keep you alive,
or at least not to kill you: the control systems in your car or in medical equipment. 1
The word <algorithm= appears somewhere in the news seemingly every day.
Therefore, it behooves you to understand algorithms not just as a student or
practitioner of computer science, but as a citizen of the world. Once you understand
algorithms, you can educate others about what algorithms are, how they operate,
and what their limitations are.
